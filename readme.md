# Altus | Sovereign AI Legal Platform (Prototype)

**Current Status:** High-Fidelity Interactive Prototype (MVP Candidate)
**Live Demo:** [Insert your GitHub Pages Link Here]

## 🚀 Executive Summary
Altus is the first AI-native legal workspace designed specifically for the **Sovereign Data requirements** of France, Spain, and Andorra. We solve the "Legal Bottleneck" for SMBs by replacing billable hours with instant, AI-verified contract drafting and review.

## 🎯 The Problem
* **Speed:** Simple contracts take days to draft via traditional counsel.
* **Cost:** High hourly rates (€300+) exclude most SMBs from proper legal coverage.
* **Sovereignty:** European firms are hesitant to use US-based AI tools due to GDPR/Data Residency risks.

## 💡 The Solution
A strictly sovereign, EU-hosted platform that combines:
1.  **AI Drafting:** Instant generation of compliant contracts (MSA, NDA, DPA, Employment).
2.  **The "Trinity" Scoring Engine:** Automated analysis for **Legality** (Jurisdiction), **Robustness** (Risk), and **Clarity** (Readability).
3.  **Partner Marketplace:** A "Human-in-the-loop" marketplace where certified lawyers monetize document validation rather than drafting from scratch.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture (Proposed)
*Note: This repository hosts the frontend logic for demonstration purposes. The production backend architecture is designed to be infrastructure-agnostic to suit Enterprise requirements.*

* **Frontend:** Lightweight, zero-dependency stack for maximum portability.
* **AI Inference:** Designed for ephemeral, stateless interaction with EU-hosted models (e.g., Mistral via Scaleway Paris).
* **Data Security:** Architecture supports AES-256 encryption at rest and strict "Zero-Retention" policies for AI inference.

## ⭐️ Demo Walkthrough
1.  **Drafting:** Select a contract type (e.g., SaaS MSA) and Jurisdiction (France/Spain/Andorra).
2.  **Analysis:** Observe the automated risk scoring.
3.  **Negotiation:** Simulate a counterparty invite and use the "Fairness Engine" to auto-balance terms.
4.  **Upsell:** See the integrated workflow for hiring a human Partner Lawyer when conflicts arise.
